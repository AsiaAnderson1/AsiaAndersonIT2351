## Creating a Database From a Script
First, I downloaded the SQL script file from Professor Tamerlano's course content. Then, I opened the script in MySql Workbench. Once the script was opened, I edited 2 lines of code to rename the database using my name. Afterwards, I used the lightening bolt to run the query and create the database on my computer.
