This repository contains all of my Lab projects from my course studies in Enterprise Database systems. It should demonstrate knowledge
and crticial understanding of relational databases. Labs will demonstrate an understanding of database creation, normalization, and implementation. Labs include use of Data Definition Language, Data Retrieval Language and Data Manipulation Language statements as a part of the creation of a complex database (5 or more tables) that adhere to business rules.
